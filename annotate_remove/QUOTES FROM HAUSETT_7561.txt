MEMOIRS OF LOUIS XV. & XVI.
By Hausset and Princess Lamballe
A liar ought to have a good memory
Air of science calculated to deceive
the vulgar
And scarcely a woman; for your answers
are very short
Bad habit of talking very indiscreetly
before others
Beaumarchais sent arms to the Americans
Because he is fat, he is thought dull
and heavy
Can make a Duchess a beggar, but cannot
make a beggar a Duchess
Canvassing for a majority to set up
D'Orleans
Clergy enjoyed one-third the national
revenues
Clouds--you may see what you please in
them
Danger of confiding the administration
to noblemen
Dared to say to me, so he writes
Dead always in fault, and cannot be put
out of sight too soon
Declaring the Duke of Orleans the
constitutional King
Do not repulse him in his fond moments
Educate his children as quietists in
matters of religion
Embonpoint of the French Princesses
Fatal error of conscious rectitude
Feel themselves injured by the favour
shown to others
Few individuals except Princesses do
with parade and publicity
Foolishly occupying themselves with
petty matters
Frailty in the ambitious, through which
the artful can act
French people do not do things by
halves
Fresh proof of the intrigues of the
Jesuits
He who quits the field loses it
Honesty is to be trusted before genius
How difficult it is to do good
I dared not touch that string
Infinite astonishment at his sharing
the common destiny
It is an ill wind that blows no one any
good
Judge of men by the company they keep
Laughed at qualities she could not
comprehend
Les culottes--what do you call them?'
'Small clothes'
Listeners never hear any good of
themselves
Madame made the Treaty of Sienna
Many an aching heart rides in a
carriage
Mind well stored against human
casualties
Money the universal lever, and you are
in want of it
More dangerous to attack the habits of
men than their religion
My little English protegee
No phrase becomes a proverb until after
a century's experience
Offering you the spectacle of my
miseries
Only retire to make room for another
race
Over-caution may produce evils almost
equal to carelessness
Panegyric of the great Edmund Burke
upon Marie Antoinette
Pension is granted on condition that
his poems are never printed
People in independence are only the
puppets of demagogues
Pleasure of making a great noise at
little expense
Policy, in sovereigns, is paramount to
every other
Quiet work of ruin by whispers and
detraction
Regardlessness of appearances
Revolution not as the Americans,
founded on grievances
Ridicule, than which no weapon is more
false or deadly
Salique Laws
Sending astronomers to Mexico and Peru,
to measure the earth
Sentiment is more prompt, and inspires
me with fear
She always says the right thing in the
right place
She drives quick and will certainly be
overturned on the road
Suppression of all superfluous
religious institutions
Sworn that she had thought of nothing
but you all her life
Thank Heaven, I am out of harness
The King remained as if paralysed and
stupefied
These expounders--or confounders--of
codes
To be accused was to incur instant
death
To despise money, is to despise
happiness, liberty...
Traducing virtues the slanderers never
possessed
Underrated what she could not imitate
We look upon you as a cat, or a dog,
and go on talking
We say "inexpressibles"
When the only security of a King rests
upon his troops
Where the knout is the logician
Who confound logic with their wishes
Wish art to eclipse nature
You tell me bad news: having packed up,
I had rather go

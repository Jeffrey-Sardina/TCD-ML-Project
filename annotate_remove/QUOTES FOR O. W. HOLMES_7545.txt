QUOTES AND IMAGES FROM O. W. HOLMES, SR.
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES
Editor's Note
This is the physician and poet, not his son of the same name who was a
Supreme Court Justice and famous in his own right. Very early on Dr.
Holmes became my mentor and guide in the philosophy of medicine.
Though his world-wide fame was based on his prose and poetry, he was
an eminent leader in medicine. Many--too many years ago I would often
assign Holmes' "Medical Essays" to a medical student whose sharp edges
of science needed some rounding-off with a touch of humanity. I have no
longer the privilege of assigning anything to anybody, yet encourage any
of you, especially any who may be physicians, to read the thoughts of a
family doctor of the early 1800's.
A misprint kills a sensitive author
Absolute, peremptory facts are bullies
Advised every literary man to have a
profession.
Afraid of books who have not handled
them from infancy
Age and neglect united gradually
Agreed on certain ultimata of belief
Algebraic symbols of minds which have
grown too weak
All his geese are swans
All men are bores, except when we want
them
All men love all women
All the forms of moral excellence,
except truth
All want to reach old age and grumble
when they get it
And now we two are walking the long
path in peace together
Another privilege of talking is to
misquote
Arc in the movement of a large
intellect
As I understand truth
As to clever people's hating each other
As a child, he should have tumbled
about in a library
Asked Solon what made him dare to be so
obstinate
Assume a standard of judgment in our
own minds
At the mercy of every superior mind
Audacious self-esteem, with good ground
for it
Automatic and involuntary actions of
the mind
Babbage's calculating machine
Be very careful to whom you trust one
of these keys
Beautiful effects from wit,--all the
prismatic colors
Been in the same precise circumstances
before
Behave like men and gentlemen about it,
if you know how.
Beliefs are rooted in human wants and
weakness, and die hard
Bells which small trades-people connect
with their shop-doors
Better for mankind,--and all the worse
for the fishes
Better too few words, from the woman we
love
Bewitching cup of self-quackery
Bill which will render pockets a
superfluity in your next suit
Blank checks of intellectual bankruptcy
Bowing and nodding over the music
Brain often runs away with the heart's
best blood
Brilliant flashes--of silence!
Brute beasts of the intellectual domain
Bury in it beliefs, doubts, dreams,
hopes, and terrors
But we must sail, and not drift, nor
lie at anchor.
But it was in talking of Life that we
came most nearly together
Called an old man for the first time
Character is distinctly shown at the
age of four months.
Cigar
Clairvoyance which sees into things
without opening them
Code of finalities is a necessary
condition of profitable talk
Cold shower-bath the world furnishes
gratis
Comfort is essential to enjoyment
Commerce is just putting his granite
foot upon them
Common sense, as you understand it.
Common sense was good enough for him
Compare the racer with the trotter
Conceit is just a natural thing to
human minds
Conceit has the virtue of making them
cheerful
Conclusion that he or she is really
dull
Conflicting advice of all manner of
officious friends
Consciousness of carrying a "settler"
in the form of a fact
Controversy
Conversation which is suggestive rather
than argumentative
Conversational fungi spring up most
luxuriantly
Conversational bully
Conversational blank checks or counters
Conversational soprano
Creative action is not voluntary at all
Crippled souls
Crow with a king-bird after him
Cut your climate to your constitution
Dangerous subjects
Demand for intellectual labor is so
enormous
Did I believe in love at first sight?
Didn't know Truth was such an invalid
Differ on the fundamental principles
Dishwater from the washings of English
dandyism
Disputing about remainders and
fractions
Do wish she would get well--or
something
Do you know how important good
jockeying is to authors?
Do you ever wonder why poets talk so
much about flowers?
Do not be bullied out of your common
sense by the specialist
Don't make your moral staple consist of
the negative virtues
Don't believe any man ever talked like
that in this world
Don't begin to pry till you have got
the long arm on your side
Don't ever think the poetry is dead in
an old man
Don't be in a hurry to choose your
friends
Doomed to the pangs of an undeceived
self-estimate
Dullest of teachers is the one who does
not know what to omit
Dulness is not commonly a game fish
Earned your money by the dose you have
taken
Easier to dispute it than to disprove
it
Easier to say this than to prove it
Educational factory
Elysian abandonment of a huge recumbent
chair.
Every person's feelings have a
front-door and a side-door
Extra talent does sometimes make people
jealous
Facts always yield the place of honor,
in conversation
Fall silent and think they are thinking
Few, if any, were ruined by drinking
Flash terms for words which truly
characterize their objects.
Fortune is the measure of intelligence
Fortune had left her, sorrow had
baptized her
Friendship authorizes you to say
disagreeable things
Gambling with dice or stocks
Gambling, on the great scale, is not
republican
Generalize the disease and
individualize the patient
Generally ruined before they became
drunkards
Genius in an essentially common person
is detestable
Gift of seeing themselves in the true
light
Give it an intellectual shake and hold
it up to the light
Give us the luxuries of life
Good for nothing until they have been
long kept and used
Good feeling helps society to make
liars of most of us
Good Americans, when they die, go to
Paris
Got his hand up, as a pointer lifts his
forefoot
Governed, not by, but according to laws
Grave without a stone where nothing but
a man is buried
Great silent-moving misery puts a new
stamp on us
Grow we must, if we outgrow all that we
love
Grow old early, if you would be old
long
Habit is a labor-saving invention
Habits are the crutches of old age
Half knowledge dreads nothing but whole
knowledge
Half-censure divided between the
parties
Hard it is for some people to get out
of a room
He did not know so much about old age
then as he does now
He that has once done you a kindness
He who is carried by horses must deal
with rogues
Height of art to conceal art
Her breathing was somewhat hurried and
high, or thoracic
Here lies buried the soul of the
licentiate Pedro Garcias
Hire logic, in the shape of a lawyer
Hold their outspread hands over your
head
Holes in all her pockets
Hoped he did deserve a little abuse
occasionally
Hopelessly dull discourse acts
inductively
How long will school-keeping take to
kill you?
Hung with moss, looking like bearded
Druids
Hydrostatic paradox of controversy
I always believed in life rather than
in books
I always break down when folks cry in
my face
I allow no "facts" at this table
I show my thought, another his
I tell my secrets too easily when I am
downhearted.
I love horses
I think I have not been attacked enough
for it
I never think I have hit hard unless it
rebounds
I replied with my usual forbearance
I am my own son, as it seems to me
I had not thought love was ever meant
for me.
I hate books
I have lived by the sea-shore and by
the mountains
I have taken all knowledge to be my
province
If so and so, we should have been this
or that
If they have run as well as they knew
how!
If I thought I should ever see the
Alps!
Il faut ne pas BRUTALISER la machine
In what direction we are moving
Incipit Allegoria Senectutis.
Infinite ocean of similitudes and
analogies
Insanity is often the logic of an
accurate mind overtasked
Insanity
Intellectual companions can be found
easily
Is this the mighty ocean?--is this all?
It is by little things that we know
ourselves
It is pleasant to be foolish at the
right time
Judge men's minds by comparing with
mine
Keep his wit in the background
Key to this side-door
Knowledge and timber only useful when
seasoned
La main de fer sous le gant de velours
Laid the egg of the Reformation which
Luther hatched
Laughs at times at the grand airs
"Science" puts on
Law of the road with regard to handsome
faces
Leading a string of my mind's daughters
to market
Leap at a single bound into celebrity
Learn anything twice as easily as in my
earlier days
Leave your friend to learn unpleasant
truths from his enemies
Lecturer is public property
Let us cry!
Liability of all men to be elected to
public office
Life would be nothing without
paper-credit
Life is maintained by the respiration
of oxygen and of sentiment
Like taking the cat in your lap after
holding a squirrel
Listen to what others say about
subjects you have studied
Little great man
Little muscle which knows its
importance
Little narrow streaks of specialized
knowledge
Live on the reputation of the
reputation they might have made
Living in a narrow world of dry habits
Logic
Logicians carry the surveyor's chain
over the track
Long illness is the real vampyrism
Look through the silvered rings of the
arcus senilis!

of men
Love-capacity is a congenital endowment
Lying is unprofitable
Made up your mind to do when you ask
them for advice

literary pickpocket
Man is father to the boy that was

out, so to speak
Mathematical fact
May doubt everything to-day if I will
only do it civilly
Meaningless blushing
Mechanical invention had exhausted
itself
Memory is a net
Men that know everything except how to
make a living
Men grow sweet a little while before
they begin to decay
Men of facts wait their turn in grim
silence
Men who have found new occupations when
growing old
Men that it weakens one to talk with an
hour
Men are fools, cowards, and liars all
at once
Might have hired an EARTHQUAKE for less
money!
Moralist and occasional sermonizer
Most of our common, working beliefs are
probabilities
Moved as if all her articulations were
elbow-joints
Much ashamed of some people for
retaining their reason
Must not read such a string of verses
too literally
Must sail sometimes with the wind and
sometimes against it
Must be weaned from his late suppers
now
Napoleon's test
Nature dresses and undresses them
Nature, who always has her pockets full
of seeds
Nearest approach to flying that man has
ever made
Neither make too much of flaws or
overstatements
Never forget where they have put their
money
No families take so little medicine as
those of doctors
No fresh truth ever gets into a book
No man knows his own voice

can live a year
None of my business to inquire what
other persons think
Nutritious diet of active sympathetic
benevolence
Oblivion as residuary legatee
Oblivion's Uncatalogued Library
Odious trick of speech or manners must
be got rid of.
Oh, so patient she is, this
imperturbable Nature!

insults and indignities
Old jokes are dynamometers of mental
tension
One very sad thing in old friendships
One whose patients are willing to die
in his hands

One that goes in a nurse may come out
an angel
One can generally tell these wholesale
thieves easily enough
Open patches where the sun gets in and
goes to sleep
Oracle
Original, though you have uttered it a
hundred times
Ought to produce insanity in every

faces
Passion never laughs

sharp pictures
Physical necessity to talk out what is
in the mind

false pretensions
Sad thing to be born a sneaking fellow
Saddle-leather is in some respects even
preferable

down to "hard pan"

crime of living

right places

handle which fits them all

many forms of superstition

to be

Struggle with the ever-rising mists of
delusion
Stupidity often saves a man from going
mad
Style is the man
Sudden conviction that I had seen it
somewhere
Takes very little to spoil everything
for writer, talker, lover
Talk about those subjects you have had
long in your mind
Talk, to me, is only spading up the
ground for crops of thought
Talk without words is half their
conversation
Talkers who have what may be called
jerky minds
Talking with a dull friend affords
great relief
Talking is like playing on the harp
Talking is one of the fine arts
Talking shapes our thoughts for us
Tears that we weep inwardly with
unchanging features
Temptation of money and fame is too
great for young people
Tepid and unstimulating expression of
enthusiasm
Terrible smile
Thanklessness of critical honesty
That great procession of the UNLOVED
The house is quite as much the body we
live in
The schoolmistress had tried life, too
The Amen! of Nature is always a flower
The race that shortens its weapons
lengthens its boundaries
The year eighteen hundred and ever-so-few
The way to argue down a vice is not to
tell lies about it
Their business is not a matter of
sympathy, but of intellect
There is no elasticity in a
mathematical fact
There is a higher law in grammar, not
to be put down
There is almost always at least one key
to this side-door
Think only in single file front this
day forward
Think of the griefs that die unspoken!
Third vowel as its center
This is the shortest way,--she said
This is one of those cases in which the
style is the man
Those who ask your opinion really want
your praise
Time is a fact
To trifle with the vocabulary
To pay up, to own up, and to shut up,
if beaten
Too late!---- "It might have been."----
Amen!
Travellers change their guineas, but
not their characters
Triumph of the ciphering hand-organ
True state of creative genius is allied
to reverie, or dreaming
Truth must roll, or nobody can do
anything with it
Truth is only safe when diluted

rounded

his tools

Unpacks and unfolds incidental
illustrations
Unpretending mediocrity is good
Virtually old when it first makes its
appearance
Virtue passed through the hem of their
parchment
Virtues of a sporting man
Vulgarism of language
Wait awhile!
Walls of that larger Inquisition which
we call Civilization
Want of ideas, want of words, want of
manners
We die out of houses, just as we die
out of our bodies
We always compare ourselves with our
contemporaries.
We are all theological students
We carry happiness into our condition
We don't read what we don't like
We never tell our secrets to people
that pump for them.
Wedded, faded away, threw themselves
away
Wedding-ring conveys a right to a key
to this side-door
Weeded their circle pretty well of
these unfortunates
What a satire, by the way, is that
machine
What are the great faults of
conversation?
Whether anything can be conscious of
its own flavor??
Whether gifted with the accident of
beauty or not
While she is silent, Nature is working
for her
Who is in advance of it or even with it
Wholesale professional dealers in
misfortune
Why authors and actors are ashamed of
being funny?
Why did I not ask? you will say
Will you take the long path with me?
Winning-post a slab of white or gray
stone

of a procession.
Wonder how my great trees are coming on
this summer.
World calls him hard names, probably
World has a million roosts for a man,
but only one nest.
Yes, I am a man, like another
Young man knows the rules, but the old
man knows the exceptions
Youth and age--something in the soul

The odd account of the origin of this Treatise--in its first
lines--caught my eye as I was turning over the leaves of the Sloane
Manuscript which contains it. I resolved to print it as a specimen of
the curious fancies our forefathers believed in (as I suppose) in
Natural Science, to go alongside of the equally curious notions they
put faith in in matters religious. And this I determined on with no idea
of scoffing, or pride in modern wisdom; for I believe that as great
fallacies now prevail in both the great branches of knowledge and
feeling mentioned, as ever were held by man. Because once held by other
men, and specially by older Englishmen, these fancies and notions have,
or should have, an interest for all of us; and in this belief, one of
them is presented here.
The loss of my sweet, bright, only child, Eena, and other distress, have
prevented my getting up any cram on the subject of Quintessence to form
a regular Preface. The (translated?) original of the text is attributed
to Hermes--Trismegistus, "or the thrice great Interpreter," so called as
"having three parts of the Philosophy of the whole world"[1]--to whom
were credited more works than he wrote. The tract appears to be a great
fuss about Alcohol or Spirits of Wine; how to make it, and get more or
less tipsy on it, and what wonders it will work, from making old men
young, and dying men well, to killing lice.
The reading of the proof with the MS. was done by Mr. Edmund Brock, the
Society's most careful and able helper. To Mr. Cockayne I am indebted
for the identification of some names of plants, &c.; and to Mr. Gill
of University College, London, for some Notes on the Chemistry of the
treatise, made at the request of my friend Mr. Moreshwar Atmaram.[2] The
Sloane MS. I judge to be about, but after, 1460 A.D.[3] The later copy
(Harleian MS. 853, fol. 66) seems late 16th century or early 17th,[3]
and has been only collated for a few passages which require elucidation.
The pause marks of the MS. and text require to be disregarded
occasionally in reading.
EGHAM, _16th May, 1866_.
P.S. The short side-notes in inverted commas on and after p. 16 (save
'5 M^e' and the like) are by a later hand in the MS. The 'Spheres' on
p. 26, and the 'Contents,' p. vii-viii, are now added.--F. 1889.

at the MSS., and puts the Sloane at 1460-70 A.D., and the Harleian

NOTES
ON THE CHEMISTRY OF THE TEXT
By C. H. GILL, Esq., of University College, London
P. 4. Direction to submit any wine _that is not sour_ to distillation.
(_Sour_ wine is deficient in alcohol; that body having been changed into
acetic acid by oxidation.) In the language of the mystical ideas which
prevailed in the dawn of Chemistry, the colouring matters, sugar, &c. of
the wine are called 'the .4. elementis,' or as it were the 'rotten faeces
of wine'??
The direction to distill the wine seven times is a good practical
suggestion for the obtaining of strong alcohol which will burn well.
Then follows a description of the distilling apparatus, which seems to
have been arranged to ensure a very slow distillation, so as to obtain a
product as colourless and scentless as possible.
P. 5. The second way to make the Quinte essence depends on distillation
of alcohol by means of the heat of fermenting horse-dung; also the fifth
manner.
P. 6. The directions for gilding burning water are all nonsense; but as
the writer had no means of testing the truth of his statements, they may
have been made in good faith.
P. 7. The idea which he expresses, that this gilt burning water will
make you well and young, is difficult to explain, except on the
assumption that, it being the strongest of alcohol, a very little served
to produce that elevation of spirits which seemed to bring back the
spring of youth.
P. 7, l. 6 from the bottom. The word _liquibles_ in the text does not
mean liquids, for a liquid cannot be made hot enough to be _quenched_.
If the original _liquibles_ cannot be retained I should substitute the
word _liquiables_, meaning those things which can be liquefied by heat.
Indeed in the next passage we find stated that if Saturn (the
alchemists' mystical name for Lead) be quenched, &c., and that if then
Mars (Iron) be quenched in the same liquid, it will acquire the softness
of Saturn. Or if you quench lead in spirit which has had iron first
cooled in it, it becomes hard.
Of course there is no truth whatever in the above statements.
P. 8. The fire without coals, &c., is 'corrosive sublimate,' most
probably containing an excess of Sulphuric acid (vitriol) as an
impurity. If Copper (Venus) or Tin (Jupiter) be dipt into this solution
of mercury they will have a deposit of mercury formed on their surface,
which will give them a pearly appearance.
P. 8. To bring Gold into calx. When gold is treated in the way directed,
a fine powder of gold of a brown or yellow colour is left. This might
readily have been mistaken for a calx by those who had no clear ideas of
what calx really was.
P. 9. The departing of gold from silver is essentially the same as the
plan practised at the present day.
To get the Quintessence of Gold. I can make nothing of the directions,
that is, I cannot see that they (the directions) hide any real truth.
P. 10. How to get the Quintessence of Antimony. I can make nothing of
this part, and can only suggest that the vinegar used contained
hydrochloric acid, and when distilled with 'Myn Antimony' (native
sulphide of antimony) gave a distillate of Chloride of Antimony
containing some 'kermes' which is red.
From this point onward there is little or nothing that can be explained
by a Chemist.

[Technical Notes and Errata:
Two entries in the Table of Contents were merged in the printed book,
apparently for reasons of space. The original form was:
HOW TO CURE FRENSY, GOUT, AND TROUBLES FROM DEVILS, WICKED THOUGHTS,
ETC., p. 17; AND HOW OUR QUINTE ESSENCE IS HEAVEN                 19
The main title page has been left as printed:
e{ess}encijs...
The internal title page was changed from
[Sloane MS. 73, fol. 10. Brit, Mus.]
The superfluous "e" and the comma after "Brit" appear to be the only
typographical errors in the book.
Each page of body text was surrounded by the following:
Top of Page:
Synopsis of page contents. This e-text preserves the page breaks and
line divisions of the 1866/1889 book.
Inner Margin:
Line numbers in increments of 4, used for Index.
Bottom of Page:
Footnotes, originally numbered from 1 on each page.
Outer Margin:
Side footnotes: Identified by asterisk rather than by number. In this
e-text they are printed directly below the referring line, in the same
way as page-bottom footnotes.
Folio number: Marked with an asterisk at the exact point of page break.
It appears to be mere coincidence that the text of folio (leaf) 26 was
printed on page 26 of the 1889 book.
Marginal notations: These are described in the "P.S." of the editor's
introduction.
Subheads: Printed in italics, with horizontal lines above and below.
Running summary: Provided by the 1866 editor. In this e-text, some of
the more fragmentary summary notes have been combined into one block.
Special Case:
On page 22, in the space at the end of a paragraph, a numbered
footnote reads [_in margin_, 'Rose / violett / Borage / lutuse/']. In
this e-text, the words have been shown as a marginal notation. ]

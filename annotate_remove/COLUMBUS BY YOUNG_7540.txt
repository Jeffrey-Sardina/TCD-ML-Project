QUOTES AND IMAGES FROM COLUMBUS BY YOUNG
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS
By Filson Young
A man standing on the sea-shore
Absent for a little time, and his
organisation went to pieces
All days, however hard, have an
evening, and all journeys an end
Amerigo Vespucci
And every one goes naked and unashamed
At last extricate himself from the
theological stupor
Attempts that have been made to glorify
him socially
Bede, in the eighth century,
established it finally (sphericity)
Began to offer bargains to the Almighty
Believed that the Spaniards came from
heaven
Biography which obscures the truth with
legends and pretences
Cannibal epicures did not care for the
flesh of women and boys
Christian era denied the theory of the
roundness of the earth
Columbus, calling for an egg, laid a
wager
Columbus never once mentions his wife
Columbus's habit of being untruthful in
regard to his own past
Cooling off in his enthusiasm as the
pastime became a task
Desire to get a great deal of money
without working for it
Diminishing object to the wet eyes of
his mother, sailed away
Dogs wagged their tails, but that never
barked
Establishment of ten footmen and twenty
other servants
Exchanging the natives for cattle
First known discovery of tobacco by
Europeans
First organised transaction of slavery
on the part of Columbus
Freed by force and with guns
Having issued three Bulls in twenty-four hours,
he desisted
He had a way of rising above petty
indignities
He was a great stickler for the
observances of religion
Hearts quick to burn, quick to forget
Heretics were being burned every year
by the Grand Inquisitor
High time, indeed, that they should be
taught to wear clothing
Idea of importing black African labour
to the New World
Ideas to him were of more value than
facts
If there were no results, there would
be no rewards
Inclined to be pompous
Irving: so inaccurate, so untrue to
life, and so profoundly dull
Islands in that sea had their greatest
length east and west
Juan Ponce de Leon, the discoverer of
Florida
Learn the blessings of Christianity
under the whip
Lives happily in our dreams, as blank
as sunshine
Logic is irresistible if you only grant
the first little step
Loose way in which the term India was
applied in the Middle Ages
Man with a Grievance
Man of single rather than manifold
ideas
More than a touch of crafty and
elaborate dissimulation
Nautical phrase "make it so."
Never to deal with subordinates
No more troubled by any wonder, sleeps
at last
No Spanish women accompanied it (2d
expedition)
Nothing so ludicrous as an Idea to
those who do not share it
Only confirmative evidence remained
Patience which holds men back from
theorising
Presence of the owner makes the horse
fat
Professors of Christ brought not peace,
but a sword
Religion has in our days fallen into
decay
Saw potatoes also, although they did
not know what they were
Sea of Darkness
Seeking to hire the protection of the
Virgin
She must either sin or be celibate
Shifts and deceits that he practised
Spaniards sometimes hanged thirteen of
them in a row
Spaniards undertook to teach the
heathen the Christian religion
St. Chrysostom opposed the theory of
the earth's roundness
Stayed till night to eat their sop for
fear of seeing (weevils)
Stuffed so full indeed that eyes and
ears are closed
Tasks that are the common heritage of
all small boys
Terror and amazement; they had never
seen horses before
The cross and the sword, the whip-lash
and the Gospel
The great thing in those days was to
discover something
The missionary walked beside the
slave-driver
The terrified seamen making vows to the
Virgin
Theologians, however, proved equal to
the occasion
There is deception and untruth
somewhere
They saw the past in the light of the
present
Took himself and the world very
seriously
Vague longing and unrest that is the
life-force of the world
When the pot boils the scum rises to
the surface
Who never could meet any trouble
without grumbling

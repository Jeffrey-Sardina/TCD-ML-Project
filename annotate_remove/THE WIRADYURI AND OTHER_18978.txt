The native tribes speaking the Wiradyuri language occupy an immense
region in the central and southern portions of New South Wales. For
their eastern and northern boundaries the reader is referred to the
map accompanying my paper to the American Philosophical Society in
1898.[1] The western boundary is shown on the map with my article to
the Royal Society of New South Wales the same year.[2] Their southern
limit is represented on the map attached to a paper I transmitted to
the Anthropological Society at Washington in 1898.[3] The maps
referred to were prepared primarily to mark out the boundaries of the
social organisation and system of marriage and descent prevailing in
the Wiradyuri community, but will also serve to indicate the
geographic range of their language.
The Wiradyuri language is spoken over a greater extent of territory
than any other tongue in New South Wales, and the object of the
present monograph is to furnish a short outline of its grammatical
structure. I have included a brief notice of the Burreba-burreba
language, which adjoins the Wiradyuri on the west. A cursory outline
is also given of the language of the Ngunawal tribe, which bounds the
Wiradyuri on a portion of the east. The Kamilaroi tribes, whose
language I recently reported to this Institute,[4] adjoin the
Wiradyuri on the north.
In all the languages treated in this article, in every part of speech
subject to inflexion, there are double forms of the first person, of
the dual and plural, similar in character to what have been reported
from many islands in Polynesia and Melanesia, and the tribes of North
America. Separate forms for "we two," and "he and I," were observed by
Rev. James Guenther among the pronouns of the Wiradyuri natives at
Wellington,[5] but as he does not mention anything of the kind in the
plural, we may conclude that he did not observe it.
The materials from which this paper has been prepared have been
gathered by me while travelling through various parts of the Wiradyuri
country, for the purpose of visiting and interviewing the old native
men and women who still speak the native tongue, from whom I noted
down all the information herein reproduced. When the difficulties
encountered in obtaining the grammar of any language which is purely
colloquial are taken into consideration, I feel sure that all
necessary allowances will be made for the imperfections of my work.
The initiation ceremonies of the Wiradyuri tribes, which are of a
highly interesting character, have been fully described by me in
contributions to several societies and other learned institutions.[6]
It will be as well to state that in 1892, Dr. J. Fraser, from the MSS.
of the late Rev. James Guenther, published some gramatical rules and a
vocabulary of the Wiradyuri language. This forms part of a volume
entitled _An Australian Language_ (Sydney, 1892), Appendix, pp.
56-120.
Mr. E. M. Curr published several vocabularies collected in different
parts of the Wiradyuri territory.--_The Australian Race_, vol. iii, pp.
363-401.
Orthography.
The system of orthoepy adopted is that recommended by the Royal
Geographical Society, London, with the following qualifications:
_Ng_ at the beginning of a word or syllable has a peculiar sound,
which I have previously illustrated.[7] At the end of a syllable or
word, it has substantially the sound of _ng_ in "sing."
_Dh_ and _nh_ have nearly the sound of _th_ in "that," with a slight
initial sound of the _d_ or _n_ as the case may be.
_Ty_ and _dy_ at the commencement of a word or syllable, as _dyirril_
(a spear), has nearly the sound of _j_. At the end of a word, as
_gillaty_ (to-day), _ty_ or _dy_ is pronounced nearly as _tch_ in the
word "batch," but omitting the final hissing sound.
_w_ always commences a syllable or word, and has its ordinary sound.
_G_ is hard in all cases. _R_ has a rough trilled sound, as in
"hurrah!"
The sound of the Spanish _n_ is frequent. At the commencement of a
syllable or word I have given it as _ny_, but when terminating a word
I have used the Spanish letter.
_T_ is interchangeable with _d_; _p_ with _b_; and _g_ with _k_ in
most words where they are used.
As far as possible, vowels are unmarked, but in some instances, to
avoid ambiguity, the long sound of _a_, _e_ and _u_ are indicated
thus: a, e, u. In a few cases the short sound of _u_ is marked _u_.
_Y_ at the beginning of a word has its ordinary consonant value.
The Wiradyuri Language.
_Articles_.
There are no articles, properly so-called, in the language. The
demonstratives "this" and "that" do duty for our "a" and "the." If it
be desired to definitely say that only _one_ is meant, the numeral,
_ngunbai_, is employed.
In all the sentences illustrating the cases of nouns and other parts
of speech in this paper, the demonstratives are omitted. A native
would say, "Man [that over yonder] beat child [this in front]," the
proper demonstratives being inserted where illustrated by the
brackets.
_Nouns_.
_Number_.--There are three numbers, singular, dual and plural.
_Wamboin_, a kangaroo. _Wamboinbula_ a couple of kangaroos.
_Wamboingirbang_, several kangaroos.
_Gender._--In human family different words are used, as _men_ or
_gibir_, a man; _bulladyeru_ or _inar_, a woman; _birrengang_, a boy;
_ingargang_, a young girl; _yiramurung_, a youth; _megai_, a maiden;
_burai_, a child.
Among animals, word are used signifying "male" and "female"
respectively. _Wille bidyur_, a buck opossum; _wille gunal_, a doe
opossum. _Ngurun burramai_, hen emu; _ngurun bidyur_, a cock emu.
_Case_.--The cases are the nominative, nominative-agent, genitive,
accusative, instrumental dative and ablative.
The nominative simply names the person or thing under attention, as,
_mirri_ or _burumain_, a dog; _burrandang_, a native-bear; _wille_ or
_womburan_, an opossum; _wagan_, a crow; _bulgang_ or _burgan_, a
boomerang.
The nominative-agent requires a suffix to the noun, as, _gibirru
womburan dhe_, a man an opossume ate. _Bulladyerudu dhurung bume_, a
woman a snake struck (or killed). _Inarru wille dharalgiri_, a woman
an opossum will eat. _Burrandangu gurril dhara_, a native-bear leaves
is eating. _Mirridu wille buddhe_, a dog an opossum bit.
_Genitive_.--_Mengu bulgang_, a man's boomerang. _Bulladyerugu kunne_,
a woman's yamstick. _Burrandanggu bullung_, a native-bear's head.
_Dative_.--_Dhurrangu_, to the creek (_dhurrang_). _Ngurangu_, to the
camp (_ngurang_).
_Ablative_.--_Dhurrandyi_, from the creek; _ngurandyi_, from the camp.
In this case, and also in the dative, the final _g_ of both words is
omitted before applying the suffix.
The accusative is the same as the simple nominative, as will be seen
by the examples given under the nominative-agent.
_Instrumental_.--When an instrument is the remote object of the verb,
the accusative remains unchanged, but the instrumental case takes the
same suffix as the nominative-agent; thus, _mendu wagan burgandu
bume_, the man hit a crow with a boomerang. _Inarru burumain kunnedu
bangabe_, the woman cut a dog with a yamstick.
In the above examples, as well as in the sentences illustrating the
nominative-agent, it will be seen that the agent suffix has euphonic
changes according to the termination of the word it is attached to.
This may be said of the suffixes in all the cases of nouns and
adjectives.
_Adjectives_.
Adjectives take the same inflexions for number and case as the nouns
they qualify, and are placed after them. They are without gender.
_Womboin munun_, a kangaroo large. _Womboinbula mununbula_, a pair of
large kangaroos. _Womboinmuddu mununmuddu_, several large kangaroos.
_Burumaindu munundu womburan buddhe_, a dog large an opossum bit.
_Inarru bubadyallu burai bume_, a woman small a child beat.
_Womboingu munungu dhun_, a large kangaroo's tail.
A big waterhole, _dha-u munun_. _Dha-ugu munungu_, to a big waterhole.
_Dha-wadyi munundyi_, from a big waterhole.
_Comparison_.--_Nyila murrumbangbun-gan_, this is vey good. _Nyilangai
murrumbang wirrai_, that is not good. If the articles compared be
equal in quality, a native would say, This is good--that is good, and
so on.
_Pronouns_.
Pronouns are inflected for number and person, and comprise the
nominative, possessive and objective cases, a few examples in each of
which will be given. There are forms in the dual plural to express the
inclusion or exclusion of the person addressed.
_Singular_.
Nominative.               Possessive.              Objective.
1st Person I         _Ngadhu_     Mine        _Ngadyi_        Me        _Ngunnhal_.
2nd "      Thou      _Ngindu_     Thine       _Nginnu_        Thee      _Nginyal_.
3rd "      He        _Ngagwa_     His         _Ngagwaiula_    Him       _Ngunnungga_.
_Dual_.
1st Person We, incl. _Ngulli_     Ours, incl. _Ngulliging_    Us, incl. _Ngullinya_.
We, excl. _Ngulliguna_ Ours, excl. _Ngulligingula_ Us, excl. _Ngullinyuggu_.
2nd "      You       _Ngindubla_  Yours       _Nginnubulala_  You       _Nginyalbula_.
3rd "      They    _Ngagwainbula_ Theirs      _Ngagwabulagu_  Them      _Ngunnainbula_.
_Plural_.
1st Person We, incl. _Ngeani_     Ours, incl. _Ngeaniging_    Us, incl. _Ngeaninyagu_.
We, excl. _Ngeaniguna_ Ours, excl. _Ngeaniginguna_ Us, excl. _Ngeaninyaguna_.
2nd "      You       _Ngindugir_  Yours       _Nginnugir_     You       _Nginyalgir_.
3rd "      They   _Ngagwainguler_ Theirs      _Ngagwagulaia_  Them      _Ngunnagulella_.
There are other forms of the objective case meaning "from me," "with
me," "towards me," etc., which have numerous modifications.
The extended forms of the pronouns given in the above table are not
much used as separate words, except in answer to interrogatives, or
assertively. _Ngulliguna_ might, for example, be given in answer to
the question, "Who killed the kangaroo?" "Whose boomerang is this?"
might elicit the reply, _Ngaddyi_.
In a common conversation, however, the pronominal affixes are
employed.
The third personal pronouns have several forms and are subject to much
variation, depending upon the position of the parties referred to.
Many of them are practically demonstratives.
_Interrogatives_.--Who, _ngandi?_ Who (agent), _nganduwa?_ Who (dual),
_nganduwanbula?_ Who (plural), _nganduwandugir?_ Who for,
_ngandigula?_ Whose is this, _ngangunginna?_ _Nganduga_ is equivalent
to "I wonder who?" or "I don't know who." Who from,
_ngangundiburrami?_ What, _minyang?_ What is that, _minyawanna?_ What
for, _minyangula?_ What from, _minyalli?_ How many (what number),
_minyanggulman?_
_Demonstratives_.--The following are a few examples:--This, _nginna_.
These (dual), _nginnabula_. This other one, _nginnagwal_. From this,
_nginnalidhi_. Belonging to this, _nginnagula_. With this,
_nginnadhurai_. That, _ngunnila_. That other one, _ngunniloagwal_.
That yonder, _ngunnainbirra_. A native will frequently state the
location of an article by its compass direction from a particular tree
or other well-known spot.
These demonstratives are very numerous--many of them being used as
pronouns of the third person, and are declined for number, person, and
case. They also vary according to the position of the object referred
to in regard to the speaker, and likewise change with the relative
position of the object to the person addressed.
In all parts of aboriginal speech, words are occasionally met with so
closely alike in pronunciation that it is almost impossible for any
one but a native to detect the difference.
_Verbs_.
The moods are the indicative, imperative, conditional, and infinitive.
The verb stem and a contraction of the necessary pronouns are
incorporated, and the words thus formed are used in the conjugation.
These are, however, modifications of the affixed particles in the past
and future tenses to express differences in time.
In the following conjugation of the verb "to beat" the present tense
is given in full. In the past and future tenses, one example in the
first person singular is thought sufficient, because any required
person and number in each tense can be obtained by following the
directions given in the text.
_Indicative Mood_--_Present Tense_.
Singular 1st Person I beat          _Bumurradhu_.
2nd "      Thou beatest    _Bumurrandu_.
3rd "      He beats        _Bumurragwa_.
Dual     1st Person We, incl., beat _Bumurrali_.
We, excl., beat _Bumurraliguna_.
2nd "      You beat        _Bumurrandubla_.
3rd "      They beat       _Bumurragwainbula_.
Plural   1st "      We, incl., beat _Bumurrani_.
We, excl., beat _Bumurraniguna_.
2nd "      You beat        _Bumurrandugir_.
3rd "      They beat       _Bumurragwainguler_.
_Past Tense_.
1st Person I beat just now     _Bumulbendhu_.
Singular,  I beat this morning _Bumulngurrindhu_.
I beat yesterday    _Bumulgwandhu_.
I beat, indefinite  _Bumedhu_.
I beat long ago     _Bumulgridyu_.
_Dhu_, softened to _dyu_ in some cases, is a contraction of _ngadhu_.
_Future Tense_.
1st Person I will beat, indefinite    _Bumulgiridyu_.
Singular,  I will beat, soon          _Bumulyawagiridyu_.
I will beat in the morning _Bumulngurrigiridu_.
Owing to the several inflections of the verb in the past and future
tneses, for immediate, proximate, and more or less remote times of the
performance of the action,[8] it is often found convenient, especially
when speaking in the dual or plural, to prefix a complete pronoun from
the table of pronouns. Thus, instead of saying, _Bumulbenli_, a native
frequently expresses it, _Ngulli bumulben_. Again, instead of saying,
_Bumulgiriniguna_, he would use, _Ngeaniguna bumulgiri_. This leaves
the termination of the verb freer for the numerous inflexions.
_Imperative Mood_.
Singular Beat thou          _Buma_.
Dual     Beat you           _Bumandubla_.
Plural   Beat you           _Bumandugir_.
_Conditional Mood_.
Perhaps I will beat. _Yama bumulgiridyu_.
_Infinitive Mood_.
To beat                        _Bumulli_.
_Reflexive_.
There is a reflex form of the verb, as when one does anything to
himself:
I am beating myself            _Bumungadyillindyu_.
_Reciprocal_.
The dual and plural contain a reciprocal form of the verb, as where
two or more persons beat each other:
We, (dual excl.,) are beating each other _Ngulliguna bumullen_.
We, (pl. excl.,) are beating each other  _Ngeaniguna bumullen_.
There is no passive. The sentence, A woman was bitten by a dog, is
expressed by, A dog bit a woman.
The prohibitive or negative in all the moods, tenses, and numbers is
obtained by using the word _Kurria_ with the verb, thus: _Kurria
buma_, beat not. _Kurria bumulgiridyu_, I will not beat. Another form
is used where there is uncertainty, as, _Wirraigurra bumulgiridyu_,
which expressed the meaning "I don't think I will beat," or, "Perhaps
I will not."
_Murrung nginyadhu_ has the meaning of "I am well," and may be called
a substitute for our verb "to be." By incorporating _yalu_ with this
expression, it makes it more emphatic, as, _Yalu murrung nginyadhu_,
"Really I am well." Any adjective describing a human attribute may be
taken as a predicate, as, good, bad, strong, sleepy, and employed with
the modifications of the word _nginya_.
_Prepositions_.
A number of prepositions are independent words, as: Behind,
_yabbungura_. In front, _willidya_. Across, _dargin_. Around,
_waiangadha_. Outside, or, on the other side, _ngunningura_. Inside,
_muguma_. This side, _nginnungaradha_. _Billaga ngunningura_, the
other side of the creek. On the right, _bumalgala_. On the left,
_mirrangur_. Ahead, _banganan_. In the rear, _ngunnagangura_.
Frequently the verb includes the meaning of a preposition, as in the
following examples:
_Ngadhu ngadyen dyirramuddyi gullegiri_, I that hill go-up-will.
_Ngadhu dyila dyirramuddyi birrawagiri_, I that hill go-down-will.
_Ngadhu ngidyi gigulle waiangugiri_, I that tree go-round-will.
_Ngeani birgudyi wurungiri_, We (pl. incl.) the scrub through-will-go.
_Ngulliguna billadyi errugiri_, We (dual excl.,) the creek will-cross.
_Ngadhu dyirramudyi ngagungurgu gulleamurrigiri_, I will climb over
the hill.
_Adverbs_.
The following are a few of the adverbs, some of which are inflected
for number, case, and tense: _Wirrai_, no. _Ngaiin_, yes. _Yandhal_,
now. _Dhallan_, soon. _Yere_, to-day. _Ngurrungal_, the morning.
_Yeregwala_, yesterday. _Ngunnigunala_, day before yesterday.
_Ngunnungalagal_, day after to-morrow. _Murradhulbul_, long ago.
_Buruandhangga_, night-time.
Here (now), _nginna_. Here (was), _nginni_. This way, _dhain_. Farther
away, _ngunna_. Still farther, _ngunneng_. A good way off,
_ngunnagunalla_. There in the rear, _ngunnagangura_. These pronominal
adverbs, like the demonstrative pronouns, are very numerous and also
include the points of the compass.
How, _widdyallangalu?_ How thou, _widdyawandu?_ How you (dual),
_widdyawandubla?_ How you (plural), _widdyawandugir?_ How obtained,
_widdyunggurrunda burramai?_ _Widdyunggawa has the meaning of "when?"
Where is it, _dhagawana?_ Where (having the meaning of "which one,")
_dhagala?_ Where are thou, _dhagawandu?_ Where are you (dual),
_dhagawandubla?_ Where are you (plural), _dhagawandugir?_ From where,
_dhadyindaburramai?_ Where art thou from, _dhadyigalliwandu?_ Where is
the camp, _dhagawa ngurung?_
_Interjections_.
_Yah!_ calling attention. _Wai!_ look out. _Wah! ngarrarbang! Ah!_
poor fellow! Listen, _winnangga!_ Any vocative can be inflexed for
number.
_Numerals_.
_Ngunbai_, one; _bulla_, two.
The Burreba-Burreba Language.
The Burreba-burreba is spoken from about Deniliquin to Moulamein, and
from the latter southerly towards the Murray river. The following is a
sketch of its grammatical structure. A dialect of this language,
called Bureba, is spoken on the Murray river, near Swan Hill.
_Number_.--There are the singular, dual, and plural numbers. _Wille_,
an opossum; _willebulet_, a pair of opossums; _willebarak_, or
_willeguli_, several opossums.
_Gender_.--_Wuthu_, a man; _leurk_, a woman; _bangga_, a boy;
_kurregurk_, a girl; _buban_, a child of either sex; _wuthuginbal_,
means a man and his wife. The gender of mammals and birds is marked by
adding _mamuk_ for male, and _babuk_ for female; thus, _gure mamuk_, a
buck kangaroo; _gure babuk_, a doe kangaroo.
_Case_.--The language has the nominative, nominative-agent, genitive,
accusative, instrumental, dative and ablative cases. In the
nominative, there is no change in the noun, except when it is the
subject of a transitive verb, and then it requires the agent-suffix;
as, _Wuthung wirrungan burdumin_, a man a dog beat; _leuru wirringal
kurgin_, a woman a perch caught; _wirrunganu gure bundin_, a dog a
kangaroo bit.
In the possessive case, the name of the proprietor and of the property
each take a suffix, as, _Wuthunggety wanuk_, a man's boomerang;
_leurgety larnuk_, a woman's camp; _wirrungangety birkuk_, a dog's
tail.
_Instrumental_.--This is the same as the nominative-agent, thus, _Ngaty
gure duggin wanu_, I a kangaroo hit with a boomerang.
_Dative_.--_larngak_, to a camp. _Ablative_.--_wuthunyu_, from a man.
The accusative is the same as the nominative.
_Adjectives_.
Adjectives follow the nouns and take similar declensions.
_Number_.--_Wuthu kurumbirt_, a man large. _Wuthubulet kurumbirtbulet_,
a couple of big men. _Wuthubarak kurumbirtbarak_, several big men.
_Nominative-agent_.--_Wuthung kurumbirru wille burdumin_, a large man
an opossum killed.
_Possessive_.--_Wuthunggety kurumbirungety wanuk_, a big man's
boomerang.
_Ablative_.--Wuthunyung kurumbirung_, from a big man.
The comparison of adjectives follows rule similar to those explained
in my article on "The Gundungurra Language."[9]
It will be observed that there are modifications in the case-endings
of nouns and adjectives, depending upon the termination of the word
declined. Moreover, these suffixes for number and case are applied to
the simple nominative--not the nominative-agent.
_Pronouns_.
Pronouns take inflexion for number, person and case. There are two
forms in the first person of the dual and plural--one in which the
person or persons addressed are included with the speaker, and another
in which they are exclusive of the speaker; these are marked "incl."
and "excl." in the following table:
_Singular_.
1st Person I         _Ngaty_     Mine        _yekaiuk_.
2nd "      Thou      _Ngin_      Thine       _Ngindaiuk_.
3rd "      He        _Malu_      His         _Maigungety_.
_Dual_.
1st Person We, incl. _Ngal_      Ours, incl. _Ngallaiuk_.
We, excl. _Ngalung_   Ours, excl. _Ngallunguk_.
2nd "      You       _Ngluen_    Yours       _Ngulaiuk_.
3rd "      They      _Malubulak_ Theirs      _Magaty-bulagaty_.
_Plural_.
1st Person We, incl. _Yangur_    Ours, incl. _Yangureuk_.
We, excl. _Yandang_   Ours, excl. _Yandeuk_.
2nd "      You       _Ngut_      Yours       _Nguteuk_.
3rd "      They      _Malugulik_ THeirs      _Ngugaty-guligaty_.
_Interrogatives_.--Who, _winyar?_ (singular)--_winyarbula_ (dual) and
_winyartukuli_ (plural). What, _nganyu?_ which also has a dual and
plural form.
_Demonstratives_.--This, _ginga_, which has a dual and plural suffix.
_Malu_, that; _kila_, that near you. _Munya_, that farther away.
_Kigety_, belonging to that. _Kigety-bulugety_, belonging to those
two. _Kigety-guligety_, belonging to all those.
_Verbs_.
Verbs have the same tenses and moods as those of the Wiradyuri, as
will be demonstrated in the conjugation of the verb "to beat." In the
Burreba-burreba verb there are, however, no regular modifications of
the past and future tenses, such meanings being expressed by separate
words.
_Active Voice_--_Indicative Mood_.
_Present Tense_.
1st Person I beat       _Ngaty tyilba_.
2nd "      Thou beatest _Ngin tyilba_.
3rd "      He beats     _Malu tyilba_.
_Past Tense_.
1st Person I beat       _Ngaty tyilbin_.
_Future Tense_.
1st Person I will beat  _Ngaty tyilben_.
_Imperative Mood_.
Beat, _tyilbak_. Beat not, _burreba tyilbak_.
_Conditional Mood_.
Perhaps I will beat, _Ngaty tyilben mumbun_.
In all the foregoing examples, the remaining persons and numbers of
the verb can be supplied by the table of pronouns.
_Middle Voice_--_Indicative Mood_.
_Present Tense_.
Singular. I am beating myself. _Tyilbanyungbenggat_.
The conjugation can be continued through all the moods, tenses, etc.,
the same as in the indicative mood.
_Reciprocal_.
We two (incl.) are beating each other, _Tyilptyerrungal_.
We all (incl.) are beating each other, _Tyilptyerrungungur_.
There are forms for all the persons and tenses.
_Adverbs_.
Yes, _ngungui_. No, _burreba_. To-day, _gillaty_. To-morrow, _perbur_.
Yesterday, _dyelli-dyellik_. By and bye, _gillandam_. Some time ago,
_gillenadya_. Long ago, _yagaluk-wanda_. Where, _windyella_?
(singular); _windyellaubul?_ (dual); _windyellat?_ (plural). How many,
_nyabur?_ Here, _kingga_. There, _nyua_.
_Numerals_.
One, _kaiapmin_. Two, _buletya_.
Initiation Ceremonies and Marriage Laws.
The initiation ceremonies of the Burreba-burreba are the same in all
essential respects as those of the Wiradyuri tribes, which I have
described in detail elsewhere.[10] The social organisation is also
similar to the Wiradyuri, comprising two phratries, each of which is
subdivided into two sections, as exemplified in the following
synopsis:--
Phratry. A man.  Marries    Sons    and Daughters.
A        _Murri_ _Ippatha_  _Umbi_  and _Butha_.
_Kubbi_ _Butha_    _Ippai_ and _Ippatha_.
B        _Ippai_ _Matha_    _Kubbi_ and _Kubbitha_.
_Umbi_  _Kubbitha_ _Murri_ and _Matha_.
Although marriages generally follow the above rules, yet in certain
cases Murri can marry Butha, and Kubbi may take Ippatha as his spouse--
a similar liberty being allowed the men of phratry B. Again, where
there is no objection arising from nearness of kin, a Murri man may
marry a Matha woman, but her totem must be different from his, and she
must belong to a distant family. This applies to the men of every
section. By the strict letters of the foregoing table, it would appear
that the child of a brother can marry the child of a sister, but this
is rigorously forbidden--the table being construed to mean that a
brother's child's child marries a sister's child's child.
Each phratry has attached to it a group of _totems_, consisting of
animals and inanimate objects. Every man, woman, and child in the
community has his particular totem, which is inherited from birth. For
further information on this subject the reader is referred to numerous
papers contributed by me to different scientific societies.
The Ngunawal Language.
The native tribes speaking the Ngunawal tongue occupy the country from
Goulburn to Yass and Burrowa, extending southerly to Lake George and
Goodradigbee.
In a contribution to the Anthropological Society at Washington in
1896, described the Bunan ceremony,[11] an elaborate type of
initiation practised by the Ngunawal in common with other communities.
In 1900 I published an account of the Kudsha[12] or Kuddya, an
abridged form of inaugural ceremony which is likewise in force among
the same people. The social organisation regulating marriage and
descent, which I described in the last mentioned article,[13] also
applies to the Ngunawal.
The Ngunawal is one of an aggregate of tribes whose sacred songs I
have learnt and published, with the accompanying music, in an article
I communicated to the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland in
1901.[14] These are the first sacred songs of the Australian
Aborigines which have ever been set to music.
_Nouns_.
_Number_.--Nouns have three numbers. _Mirri_, a dog; _mirribula_, a
couple of dogs; _mirridyimma_, several dogs.
_Gender_.--_Baual_, a man; _bullan_, a woman. Words for "male" and
"female" distinguish the gender of animals, as, _gurabun muddun_, a
bear, male; _gurabun dhuruk_, a bear, female.
_Case_.--The principal cases are the nominative, causative,
instrumental, genitive, accusative, dative and ablative.
The nominative is the name of the sbuject at rest, and is without
flexion.
The causative, or nominative-agent, represents the subject in action,
as, _bullanga gudha ngubumuin_, a woman a child beat.
_Instrumental_.--_Baualga burraingu nguburin dyuinga_, a man a wallaby
killed with a spear. Here the instrument, a spear, takes the same
suffix as the causative. The wallaby, _burrai_, takes the genitive
affix, as being the possessor or recipient of the killing.
_Accusative_.--Except in such instances as the wallaby in the last
example, the accusative is the same as the nominative.
The genitive case is represented by an affix to the name of the
property as well as to that of the owner, a peculiarity which I was
the first to report[15] in Australian languages. _Baualngu mirriwung_,
a man's dog.
Every object over which ownership may be exercised can be declined for
number and person, as under:--
Singular 1st Person My dog (dog my) _Mirridya_.
2nd "      Thy dog         _Mirridyi_.
3rd "      His dog         _MIrriwung_.
and so on through all the persons of the dual and plural.
If a couple or more articles be claimed, an infix is inserted between
the noun root and the possessive affix, thus: _Mirribuladya_, dogs
both mine; _mirridyimmadya_, dogs several mine.
_Dative_.--_Ngurani munnagai_, to the camp come.
_Ablative_.--_Ngurawurradyi yerribiwurri_, from the camp go away.
_Adjectives_.
Adjectives follow the qualified nouns, and are inflected in the same
manner for number and case. _Buru mununmang_, a kangaroo large;
_burubula mununbula_, a couple of large kangaroos; _burudyimma
munundyimma_, several large kangaroos.
_Casuative._--_Baualga mununga mirri ngubuningga_, a man large a dog
will beat. The other cases are also declined like the nouns.
Frequently one of the affixes, both in number and case, is omitted
sometimes the affix of the noun, and in other instances that of the
adjective, being thus eliminated, according to the euphony of the
expression.
A predicative adjective becomes an intransitive verb, and is
conjugated accordingly. An example in the singular will be sufficient:
Singular 1st Person I am large     _Mununmangga_.
2nd "      Thou art large _Mununmandyi_.
3rd "      He is large    _Mununman_.
Comparison of adjecitves is effected by such expressions as, _Gudba
ngunu, yeddhung nin_, bad this, good that. _Yeddhung madi ngunu_, this
is very good.
_Pronouns_.
These are declined for number, person and case, but are without
gender. They contain the inclusive and exclusive forms in the first
person of the dual and plural:
Singular 1st Person I    _Gulangga_.
2nd "      Thou _Gulandyi_.
3rd "      He   _Dhanu_.
Examples in the dual and plural are omitted, as their terminations
will appear in the conjugation of the verbs. The foregoing full forms
of the pronouns are used chiefly in answer to a question. In ordinary
conversation the pronominal suffixes to verbs, nouns and other parts
of speech, supply their place.
Towards, or with, me, _gulangguria_. Away from me, _gulangguridyia_.
Belonging to me, _gulangguia_. Myself, _mittimbaldya_, and so on. All
these can be inflected for number and person.
_Demonstratives_.--These may be classed under different heads, of which
the following are a few examples:
_Position_.--_Ngunu_, this, close. _Ngunubun_, this also. _Nin_, that.
_Ninwulu_, that only. _Wurranaguddha_, that, a little way off.
_Warranandiwang_, that, farther still. _Mudhamaguwarri_, a long way
off.
_Direction_.--_Ngunaga_, that (in rear of speaker). _Barunggo_, that
(in front of speaker). _Ngunainbil_, that this side (of something).
_Nguna-au_, that on other side (of something). _Gagurwarru_, that in
the hollow. _Warrugunnawang_, that on the rising ground, or hill.
_Size_.--_Warranalang_, that large one. _Warranuggada_, that small one.
_Possessive_.--_Ningulangu_, belonging to that. _Warranalangu_,
belonging to that large one. _Nidyulangu_, belonging to those two
persons.
_Number_.--_Warranungulu_, those two. _Warradyimmilan_, those several
animals or things.
_Person_.--_Ngunadya_, this mine. _Ngunadyi_, this thine. _Ngunawung_,
this his.
"This" and "that" in all the foregoing examples can also
mean "here" and "there" according to the context.
_Interrogatives_.--Who, _ngunnaga?_ Whose, _ngunnagangu?_ Who from,
_ngunnaganguridyi?_ What, _minya?_ What (did something), _minyaga?_
_Verbs_.
The verb has the usual moods and tenses, and is inflected throughout
for number and person. In the first person of the dual and plural
there is a variation in the affix to the verb to indicate the
inclusion or exclusion of the person spoken to.
_Indicative Mood_--_Present Tense_.
Singular 1st Person I beat          _Ngubumangga_.
2nd "      Thou beatest    _Ngubumandyi_.
3rd "      He beats        _Ngubuman_.
Dual     1st Person We, incl., beat _Ngubumanga_.
We, excl., beat _Ngubumangalu_.
2nd "      You beat        _Ngubumanbu_.
3rd "      They beat       _Ngubumanbula_.
Plural   1st Person We, incl. beat, _Ngubumanyin_.
We, excl. beat, _Ngubumanyilla_.
2nd "      You beat        _Ngubumanhu_.
3rd "      They beat       _Ngubumandyula_.
_Past Tense_.
1st Person I beat, indefinite      _Nguburingga_.
Singular,  I beat recently         _Ngubumuingga_.
I beat going along      _Ngubunyirringga_.
I beat long ago         _Nguburiangga_.
_Future_.
I will beat, indefinite _Ngubuningga_.
I will beat soon        _Ngubumunningga_.
The inflections extend through all the persons and numbers of the past
and future tenses by means of the suffixed particles shown in the
present tense.
_Imperative_.
Singular Beat thou               _Ngubi_.
Dual     Beat you                _Ngubidyaiau_.
Plural   Beat you                _Ngubidyaianhu_.
Negative or prohibitive Beat not _Ngubimuga_.
_Conditional Mood_.
Perhaps I will beat              _Ngubuninggawundu_.
_Reflexive_.
I am beating myself               _Ngubuwillimangga_.
I was beating myself              _Ngubuwilliringga_.
I will beat myself                _Ngubuwilliningga_.
and so on for the other persons and numbers.
Imperative.--Beat thyself          _Ngubuwilli_.
_Reciprocal_.
Dual   We, excl., beat each other _Ngubuwillaringalung_.
Plural We, excl., beat each other _Ngubuwillarinyilla_.
_Imperative reciprocal_.
Dual   Beat each other            _Ngubilliau_.
Plural Beat each other            _Ngubillianhu_.
An infix, _muga_, between the stem of the verb and the termination,
gives a negative meaning, as, _Ngubumugamangalu_, we, dual exclusive,
did not beat.
There is no passive form of the verb, all sentences being in the
active voice, thus, instead of saying, "A boomerang was thrown by the
man," the phrase would be, "The man threw a boomerang."
The verb is inflected for the same number as the noun.
A kangaroo saw I, _buru nangurringga_.
A pair of kangaroos saw I, _burumbla nangurringbla_.
Several kangaroos saw I, _burulula nangurringdyula_.
Different shades of meaning are imparted to verbs by additions to the
affixes:
I was eating going along, _dhaimballinyirrimuingga_.
I beat before (some event), _ngubururingawung_.
I beat after (some event), _ngubullaringawung_.
I threw frequently, _yerrimbillidyingga_.
I was throwing alone, _yerrilimuingga_.
I am always beating, _ngubadyingga_.
_Adverbs_.
Yes, _ngi_. No, _gurragan_. Now, _yanggu_. Yesterday, _burranda_. By
and by, _gaugau_. Long ago, _nudyina_. Always, _bulu_.
How, _ngindyin_. How many, or what number, _wunnamalan_. Where,
_wunda_. Certainly, _ganni_. Then, _yanbi_. Very or really, _madi_.
Perhaps, _wundu_. Not, _muga_. When, _wundin_.
Certain adverbs can be inflected for person and number, thus:
Where shall I go? _Wundayerrabunningga?_
Where shalt thou go? _Wundayerrabunnindyi?_
Where shall he go? _Wundayerrabunnin?_
and so on for all persons and numbers.
_Prepositions_.
On top, _gunna_. Down, _dhugga_. Between, _dhuri_. Behind me,
_bengalwarria_. Outside, _bunnungga_. Out of that, _barridyi_. In rear
of me, _wullingaia_. In here, _ngunna_. In or under there, _ngunnin_.
Words meaning "is here," "was here," "will be here," also exist in
this language.
Many prepositions can be inflected for number and person:
Singular 1st Person In front of me   _Ngunalundya_.
2nd "      In front of thee _Ngunalundyi_.
3rd "      In front of him  _Ngunalung_.
and so on through the dual and plural.
_Exclamations_.
_Ya!_ calling attention.--_Bungamugi_, cease!
_Numerals_.

QUOTES AND IMAGES:  MEMOIRS OF MADAME DE MONTESPAN
THE MEMOIRS OF MADAME DE MONTESPAN
By Madame de Montespan
All the death-in-life of a convent
Always sold at a loss which must be
sold at a given moment
Ambition puts a thick bandage over the
eyes
And then he would go off, laughing in
his sleeve
Armed with beauty and sarcasm
Cannot reconcile themselves to what
exists
Conduct of the sort which cements and
revives attachments
Console me on the morrow for what had
troubled me to-day
Cuddlings and caresses of decrepitude
Depicting other figures she really
portrays her own
Domestics included two nurses, a
waiting-maid, a physician
Extravagant, without the means to be so
Grow like a dilapidated house; I am
only here to repair myself
Happy with him as a woman who takes her
husband's place can be
Hate me, but fear me
He contradicted me about trifles
He was not fool enough for his place
I myself being the first to make merry
at it (my plainness)
In the great world, a vague promise is
the same as a refusal
In Rome justice and religion always
rank second to politics
In ill-assorted unions, good sense or
good nature must intervene
In England a man is the absolute
proprietor of his wife
Intimacy, once broken, cannot be
renewed
It is easier to offend me than to
deceive me
Jealous without motive, and almost
without love
Kings only desire to be obeyed when
they command
Knew how to point the Bastille cannon
at the troops of the King
Laws will only be as so many black
lines on white paper
Love-affair between Mademoiselle de la
Valliere and the King
Madame de Sevigne
Madame de Montespan had died of an
attack of coquetry
Not show it off was as if one only
possessed a kennel
Permissible neither to applaud nor to
hiss
Poetry without rhapsody
Present princes and let those be
scandalised who will!
Respectful without servility
Satire without bitterness
Says all that he means, and resolutely
means all that he can say
She awaits your replies without
interruption
Situations in life where we are
condemned to see evil done
Talent without artifice
That Which Often It is Best to Ignore
The King replied that "too much was too
much"
The monarch suddenly enough rejuvenated
his attire
The pulpit is in want of comedians;
they work wonders there
Then comes discouragement; after that,
habit
There is an exaggeration in your sorrow
These liars in surplice, in black
cassock, or in purple
Time, the irresistible healer
Trust not in kings
Violent passion had changed to mere
friendship
Weeping just as if princes had not got
to die like anybody else
Went so far as to shed tears, his most
difficult feat of all
What they need is abstinence,
prohibitions, thwartings
When women rule their reign is always
stormy and troublous
When one has seen him, everything is
excusable
When one has been pretty, one imagines
that one is still so
Wife: property or of furniture, useful
to his house
Wish you had the generosity to show,
now and again, less wit
Women who misconduct themselves are
pitiless and severe
Won for himself a great name and great
wealth by words
Would you like to be a cardinal?  I can
manage that
You know, madame, that he generally
gets everything he wants

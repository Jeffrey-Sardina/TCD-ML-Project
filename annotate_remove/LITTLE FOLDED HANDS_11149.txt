With rosy light
Has waked me from my sleep;

My sins forgive
And let me live,
Blest Jesus, near Thy side. Amen.

Psalm 23.
114.
1. The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.
2. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the
still waters.
3. He restoreth my soul; He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
His name's sake.
4. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort
me.
5. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies;
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
The Common Doxology.
115.
Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;

Praise Him above, ye heavenly host:
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

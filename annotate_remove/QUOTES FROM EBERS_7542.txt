masters

happiness of mortals

in solitude

live upon
The altar where truth is mocked at
The older one grows the quicker the
hours hurry away
The shirt is closer than the coat
The beginning of things is not more
attractive
The mother of foresight looks backwards
The greatness he had gained he
overlooked
The dressing and undressing of the holy
images
The god Amor is the best schoolmaster
The not over-strong thread of my good
patience
The man within him, and not on the
circumstances without
The scholar's ears are at his back:
when he is flogged
The best enjoyment in creating is had
in anticipation
The experienced love to signify their
superiority
Then hate came; but it did not last
long
There is no 'never,' no surely
There are no gods, and whoever bows
makes himself a slave
There is nothing better than death, for
it is peace
They who will, can
They praise their butchers more than
their benefactors
They keep an account in their heart and
not in their head
They get ahead of us, and yet--I would
not change with them
Thin-skinned, like all up-starts in
authority
Think of his wife, not with affection
only, but with pride
Those are not my real friends who tell
me I am beautiful
Those who will not listen must feel
Those two little words 'wish' and
'ought'
Those whom we fear, says my uncle, we
cannot love
Thou canst say in words what we can
only feel
Though thou lose all thou deemest thy
happiness
Thought that the insane were possessed
by demons
Time is clever in the healing art
Title must not be a bill of fare
To pray is better than to bathe
To govern the world one must have less
need of sleep
To know half is less endurable than to
know nothing
To her it was not a belief but a
certainty
To the child death is only slumber
To expect gratitude is folly
To the mines meant to be doomed to a
slow, torturing death
To whom the emotion of sorrow affords a
mournful pleasure
To whom fortune gives once, it gives by
bushels
To-morrow could give them nothing
better than to-day
To be happy, one must forget what
cannot be altered
Tone of patronizing instruction assumed
by the better informed
Trifling incident gains importance when
undue emphasis is laid
Trouble does not enhance beauty
True host puts an end to the banquet
Trustfulness is so dear, so essential
to me
Two griefs always belong to one joy
Unjust to injure and rob the child for
the benefit of the man
Until neither knew which was the giver
and which the receiver
Unwise to try to make a man happy by
force
Use their physical helplessness as a
defence
Use words instead of swords, traps
instead of lances
Usually found the worst wine in the
taverns with showy signs
Vagabond knaves had already been put to
the torture
Very hard to imagine nothingness
Virtues are punished in this world
Voice of the senses, which drew them
together, will soon be mute
Wait, child!  What is life but waiting?
Waiting is the merchant's wisdom
Wakefulness may prolong the little term
of life
War is a perversion of nature
We live for life, not for death
We quarrel with no one more readily
than with the benefactor
We each and all are waiting
We've talked a good deal of love with
our eyes already
Welcome a small evil when it barred the
way to a greater one
Were we not one and all born fools
Wet inside, he can bear a great deal of
moisture without
What had formerly afforded me pleasure
now seemed shallow
What changes so quickly as joy and
sorrow
What are we all but puny children?
What father does not find something to
admire in his child
Whatever a man would do himself, he
thinks others are capable of
When love has once taken firm hold of a
man in riper years
When a friend refuses to share in joys
When men-children deem maids to be weak
and unfit for true sport
When hate and revenge speak, gratitude
shrinks timidly
When you want to strike me again,
mother, please take off
Whether the form of our benevolence
does more good or mischief
Whether man were the best or the worst
of created beings
Whether the historical romance is ever
justifiable
Who watches for his neighbour's faults
has a hundred sharp eyes
Who can point out the road that another
will take
Who can be freer than he who needs
nothing
Who only puts on his armor when he is
threatened
Who does not struggle ward, falls back
Who gives great gifts, expects great
gifts again
Who do all they are able and enjoy as
much as they can get
Who can take pleasure in always seeing
a gloomy face?
Who can prop another's house when his
own is falling
Who can hope to win love that gives
none
Whoever condemns, feels himself
superior
Whoever will not hear, must feel
Wide world between the purpose and the
deed
Wise men hold fast by the ever young
present
Without heeding the opinion of mortals
Woman who might win the love of a
highly-gifted soul (Pays for it)
Woman's disapproving words were blown
away by the wind
Woman's hair is long, but her wit is
short
Women are indeed the rock ahead in this
young fellow's life
Wonder we leave for the most part to
children and fools
Words that sounded kindly, but with a
cold, unloving heart
Wrath has two eyes--one blind, the
other keener than a falcon's
Ye play with eternity as if it were but
a passing moment
Years are the foe of beauty
You have a habit of only looking
backwards
Young Greek girls pass their sad
childhood in close rooms
Youth should be modest, and he was
assertive
Youth calls 'much,' what seems to older
people 'little'
Zeus pays no heed to lovers' oaths

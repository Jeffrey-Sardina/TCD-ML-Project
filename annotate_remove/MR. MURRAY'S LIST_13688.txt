_SPEECHES DELIVERED IN INDIA_,
1884-8.
INCLUDING THAT AT "THE ST. ANDREW'S DINNER."
By the MARQUIS OF DUFFERIN AND AVA.
_8vo. 9s._
"We earnestly commend the perusal of these speeches to the English
reader. They are the best possible antidote for the rashness, ignorance,
and folly which are the too common characteristics of amateur criticism
of Indian politics. They are, moreover, agreeable reading; for Lord
Dufferin, serious and well considered as are his observations, is never
dull, and, whenever occasion permits, breaks away into a
light-heartedness that reminds us that he is a true Irishman, and that
the Sheridan blood flows in his veins. His touch is light; his spirits
are gay; his fancy plays at ease. Whenever, for a moment, the senatorial
purple is thrown aside, we perceive the courteous, kindly gentleman,
sincerely pleased with the world in which he has played so distinguished
a part, and the men and women whom his genial disposition and charming
manners have bound to himself in the firm allegiance of personal
affection. He is proud of his country, of his class, of his past good
fortune, and--as he takes every opportunity of announcing--of his
wife."--_Saturday Review_.
"In this charming collection there are not many speeches which compare
in importance and oratorical elevation with the brilliant orations and
despatches of Lord Dufferin's Canadian administration; but we have a
volume abounding in light on Indian history and rich in hereditary
refinement of diction and vivacity of perception.... The actual
condition of the Indian Empire at the time Lord Dufferin became Viceroy,
and the healing influence his personality exercised upon the
inflammation produced by many attempts to exploit India for party
purposes, constitute some of Lord Dufferin's strongest claims to
recognition among the great men who have made the English name renowned
in the Indian world."--_Observer_.

_OUR VICEREGAL LIFE IN INDIA._
BEING A SELECTION FROM MY JOURNAL DURING THE YEARS 1884-8.
By THE MARCHIONESS OF DUFFERIN AND AVA.
_Fourth Thousand. With Portrait & Map. 2 Vols. Crown 8vo. 24s._
"All who understand and sympathise with Indian life will hasten to read
these two pleasant volumes. The journal is a running commentary on the
multitudinous events which must crowd into such years as she passed in
India, and is none the less pleasant for its simplicity and
unpretentiousness. Perhaps the visit which Lady Dufferin paid to Burmah
three years ago will attract as much attention as any other part of her
travels."--_Daily Telegraph_.

_A SOUTHERN PLANTER._
By SUSAN DABNEY SMEDES.
_Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d._
"The book is eminently worthy of the great attention it has received. It
puts the case of the Southern planters in a very rational and most
interesting light. It may be described as the very antipodes to 'Uncle
Tom's Cabin.' The picture of the rich, affluent patriarchal life, with
woodlands, pastures and countless flocks, the master exercising paternal
care over the slaves, and the planter's wife, working harder for her
slaves than any slave could work, is extremely interesting and
attractive. Then we have some striking pictures of the war between
Federals and Confederates, and of the tremendous results. But the main
charm of the book is the character of Thomas Dabney himself, who might,
as a reality, be compared with some famous characters in fiction, with
the Doctor Primrose of Goldsmith, or the Père Madelon of Victor Hugo....
Mr. Gladstone has done well in drawing attention to his character and
his story."--_Literary Churchman_.

_FOUR YEARS' TRAVELS IN
AUSTRALIA._
AND CAMP LIFE WITH THE ABORIGINES OF QUEENSLAND.
By CARL LUMHOLTZ, M.A.,
Member of the Royal Society of Science of Norway.
_With Maps, Coloured Plates and 120 Illustrations. Medium 8vo. 24s._
"Mr. Lumholtz has a very pleasant and modest style of narrative, so that
the whole book is as agreeable as it is instructive; but the portion
most attractive from its novelty is that which details his proceeding
when, for nearly a year, he lived alone among 'a race of people whose
culture--if, indeed, they can be said to have any culture whatever--must
be characterised as the lowest to be found among the whole genus _homo
sapiens_.' The volume is one of the most complete of its kind in all
respects, and a worthy record of the steadfast enterprise of a hardy
Norseman in the Scientific Age. It should be specially remarked that he
effaces himself more than most travellers; yet we can infer from the
style and fine temper of his narrative that he belongs to the higher
class of scientific explorers."--_Spectator_.

_A NATURALIST'S VOYAGE ROUND
THE WORLD_.
By CHARLES DARWIN, F.R.S.,
WITH MAPS AND UPWARDS OF 100 ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PLACES VISITED AND
DESCRIBED.
_Chiefly from Sketches taken on the Spot by_ ROBERT TAYLOR PRITCHETT.
_Medium 8vo. 21s._
*.* _The object of this edition is to aid the author's description by
actual representations of the most interesting places and objects of
Natural History referred to in them. This has been effected by securing
the service of an artist who has visited the countries which Darwin
describes._
"This is an edition de luxe of the first work written by our great
naturalist. Anybody who has read it is not likely to have forgotten it.
It is a kind of natural history 'Robinson Crusoe.' It was during that
famous voyage that Darwin made the observations and laid the foundation
for his famous theory of Natural Selection. The present edition is by
far the best and most attractive hitherto published. The illustrations
are artistic in the highest degree, as everybody will understand when he
knows they are by the artist of Lady Brassey's 'Sunbeam.' Most of them
are from sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Darwin's book
by his side."--_Science Gossip_.

_THE BATTLE ABBEY ROLL_
WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE NORMAN LINEAGES.
By the DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND.
_3 Vols. Small 4 to. 48s._
"These handsome volumes are a solid monument to the industry and
learning of the Author. On the whole the book is very much above the
average of Antiquarian productions. The accounts of the leading families
are given with accuracy and generally in an interesting manner. The
three volumes are evidently a labour of love, and reflect no little
credit on the industry, the knowledge and the capacity of their
Author."--_Guardian, May_, 1890.

By PAUL B. DU CHAILLU.
Author of "Explorations in Equatorial Africa," "Land of the Midnight
Sun," &c.
_With 1360 Illustrations. 2 Vols. 8vo. 42s._

a great and important chapter in human life, which is nowhere else to be
found in such a ready and convenient form."--_Guardian_.

_THE RAILWAYS OF AMERICA_.
THEIR CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND APPLIANCES.
By VARIOUS WRITERS.
WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY THOMAS M. COOLEY.
Chairman of the Inter-State Commerce Commission.
_With Maps, Charts, and 200 Illustrations. (480 pp.) Large 8vo. 31s.
6d._
"There is far more of interest and information in the book than we have
been able to allude to; and it is perhaps not entirely unsatisfactory to
the English reader to find, on the authority of the Americans
themselves, that with all their energy and inventiveness, we are
obviously still ahead of them in the art of rendering railway travelling
at once speedy and safe, and in general principles and details. American
engineers are behind no others of this epoch in talent and resource, but
American railway working seems not yet to have surmounted the drawbacks
arising from an inherently loose system of construction and working,
fixed upon it at the outset by the desire for economy and by the lack of
that feeling of responsibility for public safety which seems much more
developed in the English character in connexion with public works of
this kind. England has the credit of having invented the railway system,
with all its vast consequences to the world, and we may be allowed as a
nation to feel some pardonable pride in the assurance that in its
working and management we are still in front of all other
nations."--_The Builder_.

"Although most people have some conception and experience of the miracle
of the age known as the railway, there are few who have even a general
understanding of it, and fewer still who possess definite knowledge of
its ramifications and details. Some such summary as Mr. Acworth gives is
requisite to convey a real and lasting impression of the immensity of
the organization and its daily effect upon the present conditions of
life."--_Birmingham Daily Gazette_.
_BY THE SAME AUTHOR_.
_THE RAILWAYS OF SCOTLAND_.
THEIR PRESENT POSITION, WITH A GLANCE AT THEIR PAST, AND A FORECAST OF
THEIR FUTURE.
_With a Map of the Scottish Railway System. Crown 8vo. 5s._
"Mr. Acworth has lost no time in following up his interesting book on
English railways with a very readable companion volume. This is a
concise review of the past history of Scottish railway enterprise, and a
suggestive survey of the present outlook, with its notable activity of
competition and exploitation. From both aspects Mr. Acworth's book, with
its admirable map of existing lines and lines in progress, is eminently
satisfactory. Burning questions of amalgamation or of competitive and
retaliatory policies are treated with discretion. They are discussed, as
was inevitable, but discussed within sober and proper
bounds."--_Saturday Review_.

_A NATURALIST IN NORTH CELEBES;_
A NARRATIVE OF TRAVELS IN MINAHASSA, THE SANGIR AND TALAUT ISLANDS,

By SYDNEY J. HICKSON,
M.A. (Cantab.), D.Sc. (Lond.), F.Z.S., Fellow of Downing College, Camb.
_With 2 Maps and 36 Illustrations. 8vo. 16s._
"Dr. Hickson ranks as the naturalist-historian of Malay Archipelago, and
is an undoubted authority on corals and the general fauna of tropical
seas. But he is more than a naturalist--he is an ethnologist and a
folklorist of high value. This work is a valuable, conscientious, and
pleasantly written addition to the libraries of all who, with 'Childe
Harold,' 'converse with Nature's charms, and view her shores unrolled.'
The maps are of especial value."--_Daily Telegraph_.

WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THEIR HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS.
By JANET ROSS.
Author of "Three Generations of Englishwomen."
_With Map and Illustrations. Crown 8vo. 10s. 6d._
"A charming little volume. Many of the towns along the coast were
visited by Mrs. Ross, and the leading events connected with their
history are very graphically described. These pages of Mrs. Ross's will
undoubtedly tempt many of her compatriots to visit this fair unknown
land, to its and the traveller's benefit."--_Nature_.

_THE PHYSIOLOGY OF INDUSTRY;_
BEING AN EXPOSURE OF CERTAIN FALLACIES IN EXISTING THEORIES OF
ECONOMICS.
By A.F. MUMMERY and J.A. HOBSON.
_Crown 8vo. 6s._
"This is one of the most remarkable contributions to the economic
controversy lately seen. The authors set themselves out as antagonistic
to most of the received theories, and especially to controvert Mill's
position that 'saving enriches, and spending impoverishes the community
along with the individual.' The argument is full of acute observation,
and the industrial process, as we may call it, is exposed to a careful
scientific dissection.... The volume is eminently readable and
valuable."--_North British Economist_.

"Mr. Sturgis has a charming manner of writing social comedy. His touch
is light and graceful."--_Morning Post_.
"Mr. Julian Sturgis is a very clever man, and there is so much
cleverness in his 'Comedy of a Country House,' that no reader who knows
good work when he sees it, can fail to render hearty and ungrudging
admiration. The true tone of comedy is, on the whole, admirably
maintained."--_Spectator_.

in her work. Her characters live and breathe and impress us. We shall
anxiously look for more of her work."--_Guardian_.
"It was not an easy task to write a novel like 'Major Lawrence, F.L.S.'

"Those who would study the subject fully, and it is well worth it, must
go to the extremely able and carefully written book which Sir Monier
Williams has produced. They will learn the relation of Buddhism to the
earlier thoughts of India. They will have the details of the present
faith and worship of Buddhists in different lands, with full accounts of
the works, and beautifully engraved pictures of idols, temples and
relics."--_The Rock_.
"It would have been difficult to have found a more thoroughly qualified
exponent of the mysteries of Buddhism than Professor Monier Williams.
Readers will find the story of Buddhism clearly told, both in its
outward manifestations and its esoteric leading, in a volume made
readable by capital type, and pleasant by many
illustrations."--_Guardian_.

"This excellent edition of Pope supersedes all its predecessors, and to
a study of Pope's life and works is absolutely indispensable. All that
is valuable in the notes of previous editors is preserved. The new
Prefaces and Notes contain an extraordinary amount of information, much
of which appears for the first time. It is impossible to praise too
highly the patient care and painstaking industry with which facts are
sifted, omissions supplied, errors corrected."--_Edinburgh Review._
"Though the life and works of the poet will still continue to be the
battle-ground of students of English literature, no combatant can regard
himself as adequately equipped for the contest who has not studied the
suggestive criticism both of Pope's poetry and character, which is
contained in Volume V. of this monumental edition."--_The Quarterly

attention, and these essays will well repay it.... Theologians are
discussed here, by one who is both theologian and philosopher, with
great learning and breadth of view and with equal courage and
honesty.--_Scotsman_.
"Anything from Professor Pritchard's pen is sure to be received with
thankfulness all round. This volume is in reality a series of discourses
which he has given at various times and in divers places to the British

open new views to many a pious student, give definiteness to the
aspirations of many a devout soul, and be the means, we doubt not, of
encouraging a more intelligent use of that Psalter which forms so large

ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED.
WITH DESCRIPTION OF PLACES, RAILWAY STATIONS, HOTELS, &c.
_New and Revised Edition (1890). One Volume, with Map. Post 8vo. 12s._
"Murray's Handbooks have always been distinguished for the high quality
of their literary and architectural information. In the volume before us
under each place-name is given a description of the place, railway
stations, hotels, and excursions best deserving of the traveller's
attention. It will thus be seen that such information is given as will
suffice for all ordinary purposes. The book is likely to be of as much
use in the library as a handy gazetteer of home travel."--_Literary

Gazetteer; only such names being given as belong to places of interest.
This includes most places that anyone will care to learn about, and the
book will, therefore, be a useful manual of reference for the library,
no less than the pocket or travelling-bag."--_The Bookseller_.

"It is not too much to say that this work is the most solid contribution
to the materials of theological study and of ecclesiastical history
which our age has seen, and we doubt whether the clergy of any other
branch of the Church Catholic could at this time produce a record of the
earlier ages of Christianity so learned, so impartial, and so
comprehensive. As it stands it does the highest honour to the clergy of
the Church of England at the present day."--_Edinburgh Review._

"We feel that this Commentary on the Apocrypha marks a distinct advance
in English theological scholarship. We can hardly imagine that thirty or
even twenty years ago anything of the kind would have been
attempted."--_Record_.
"Dr. Wace and his able coadjutors have done their work in so thorough,
scholarly, and workmanlike, luminous, and yet so readable a manner, that
they have left little to be desired. It is far and away the best guide
to the study of the Apocrypha yet issued from the English or American
press."--_Nonconformist_.

UNIVERSITY EXTENSION MANUALS.
The Series of University Extension Manuals, to be published by Mr.
MURRAY, of Albemarle Street, London, under the Editorship of Professor
KNIGHT, of the University of St. Andrews, is primarily designed to aid
the University Extension movement throughout the country, and to supply
the need so widely felt by Students, of Text-books for study and
reference, in connection with the authorised Courses of Lectures.
These Manuals will differ from those already in existence in that they
are not intended for School use, or for Examination purposes; and that
their aim is to educate, rather than to inform. The enumeration of mere
details will be avoided, except in so far as they illustrate the working
of general laws, and the development of principles; while the historical
evolution, both of the literary and scientific subjects, will be kept in
view, as well as their philosophical significance. The class for whose
use the Manuals are especially designed are those whose education has
been hitherto somewhat miscellaneous or fragmentary, and who are
desirous of pursuing systematic study in Literature, History, Science,
and Art.
The remarkable success which has attended University Extension in
England and Scotland has been partly due to the combination of
scientific treatment with popularity, and the union of simplicity with
thoroughness. The University Extension movement, however, can only reach
those resident in the larger centres of population, while all over the
country there are thoughtful persons who desire the same kind of
teaching; and it is for them, as well as for the Extension Lecture
Students, that this Series is designed. Its aim will be to supply to the
public and to the general reader, the same kind of teaching as is given
in the Lectures, to reflect the spirit which has characterised the
movement, and to combine as the Lectures have done, the discussion of
principles as well as of facts, and of methods along with results.
The Manuals will be issued simultaneously in England and America.
Volumes dealing with separate sections of Literature, Science,
Philosophy, History, and Art have already been assigned to
representative literary men, to University Professors, or to Extension
Lectures connected with Oxford, Cambridge, London, and the Universities
of Scotland and Ireland.
